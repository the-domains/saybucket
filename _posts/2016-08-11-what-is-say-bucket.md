# What is Say Bucket? 

The Bucketlist is where your dreams go when they have no place on your short-term to-do list.

Take the dog for a walk; wash the car and....... learn to fly a helicopter?

You know you want to do it and perhaps you have wanted to know your whole life, so where do you go to make this dream a reality?

This website will offer group buying for your bucketlist item. Once priced and sourced by our team, it will be offered to the public with a group-buy discount. Get 10 people to join? You pay 10% of the total group cost. Get 20 and you pay 5% of the total group cost... get the picture?

We will negotiate a rate and suggest the number of participants you need to make the dream a reality within your budget! Want to take a private plane to a private island with 10 of your closest friends.... then Say Bucket. Want to have lunch with Richard Branson.... then Say Bucket. What to get your motocycle licence?
